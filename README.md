## General info
Hi, I'm glad you got here.

This repository contains end-to-end machine learning project concerning tabular data binary classification. It's a response to the Kaggle [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview) competition.

The project is intended for beginners who start their adventure with machine learning. It contains a basic implementation of the most popular machine learning classification models with comments. However, I hope more advanced find something for themselves as well.

## Technologies
The project has been created using **JupyterLab** and **Python** with libraries in versions:
```
jupyterlab==3.4.4
IPython==8.4.0
ipywidgets==7.7.1
python==3.10.4
pandas==1.4.3
numpy==1.23.1
matplotlib==3.5.2
sklearn==1.1.2
seaborn==0.11.2
pandas_profiling==3.2.0
xgboost==1.6.1
lightgbm==3.3.2
```

## Setup
You need a program that supports the Jupyter notebook as well as having access to Python. If you use pip (the package installer for Python) you can install all necessary packages from within the project notebook. If you only want to take a look - just click on the [`project_titanic.ipynb`](https://github.com/mowczarz/ml-classification-project-titanic/blob/main/project_titanic.ipynb).

Have fun!
